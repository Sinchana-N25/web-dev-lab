# 🌐 web-dev-lab

A hands-on collection of web development experiments and mini-projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 🛠️

This repo includes creative folders like:
- ⛅ Weather app demos  
- 📝 Poem generator  
- 😂 Joke generator 
- 📰 Article previews and blog layouts

Each project is a quick playground to explore frontend concepts, sharpen UI logic, and build interactive features — all written with clarity and curiosity. 💡

Feel free to explore, remix, and revisit ideas as your skills grow! 🚀
