        <p>I love Books!!!<br><br> I'm a huge bookwork and an avid book reader. I usually read fiction as it helps me
            travel to
            another world through imagination. It's really beautiful how a book can make you travel dimensions just from
            the comfort of your couch.<br><br> There are many forms of books but I obviously prefer the physical copy as
            would
            any book lover. Reading books was something I picked up from a young age and I started writing many essays
            and some poems too.<br><br> Coming to the storyline and characters, they bring colour to your reading
            sessions.
            Imagining your life as another character's is something I do on a daily basis while zoning out in classrooms
            occassionally. <br><br>Books are so beautiful and I honestly can not relate to those who do not read any. My
            top
            genres are mystery, thriller, suspense, action, comedy and fantasy. These provide me the most joy I could
            ever ask for. <br><br>Books are your pals and will always stick with you regardless of what's going on
            anywhere.<br><br>
            Therefore, books are simply the best forms of entertainment for me and reading them is one of my most
            favourite hobbies.</p>
